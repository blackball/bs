======
Pixel-wise background subtraction method.

A more well designed API will be in version 2
=====
I name it as bs (background substraction).

Update:
@date 3/15/2012
  -add new C version in bs.h and bs.c, testing example in bs_example.cpp
@TODO: 
  -clean-up
  -optimization

Update 2012-10-08:

The API is not as simple as it should be, and there still
a lot of optimization spaces left.

I will refactor the codes, and I think if I model the
foreground pixels in the time-domain, it will be more
useful.So After refactoring this codes, I plan to release
a more powerful version both for background substraction and
foreground filtering.
